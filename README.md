All logic is in one page, will make a better web app version of this in the future

<strong>The Game</strong>
- The player has 7 tries to correctly guess the sequence of 4 colors. There is no repition of colors.
- Each guess of 4 colors results in a change in the small right circles on the right for each row. The indicators do not follow the sequence of the guesses.
  - White means right color but wrong place
  - Black means right color and right place
  - Gray means wrong color.
- If the player guesses the 4 colors correctly, the game will end
- If the player does not guess the colors in time, the game will reveal the colors at the end of the 7 turns
